# Deep Learning Mini Projects

This repository contains my hands-on practice and mini projects in 
Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Natural Language Processing.

## Topics Covered
- Neural Network basics (XOR problem, arrays)
- Deep Learning models (LSTM, Autoencoder, Regularization)
- Natural Language Processing (Sentiment Analysis, POS tagging, Translation)
- Computer Vision (Face detection, Image Augmentation)
- Machine Learning applications (Credit card fraud detection)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Scikit-learn

## Purpose
These projects were developed as part of my learning journey to understand 
core concepts of AI, Deep Learning, and Data Science through practical implementation.
